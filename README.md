- **SCAN** [^1] is specifically designed to identify clusters, hub nodes, and outliers within a given graph. Here the nodes that belong to identified clusters are considered anomalies. SCAN only uses the structure of the graph as input.
- **MLPAE**	[^2] encodes node attributes using a multiple-layer perceptron (MLP), reconstructs the attributes using another MLP, and identifies anomaly nodes based on the reconstruction errors. MLPAE only uses the attribute of the nodes.
- **DOMINANT** [^3] takes both structure and attribute information as input, and employs GCN to reconstruct the structure and attribute separately. The reconstruction error is then used to identify anomalies.
- **CoLA** [^4] measures node abnormality based on the agreement between each node and its neighboring subgraph with a GNN-based encoder model.
- **ANEMONE** [^5] measures node abnormality based on the agreement of multiple scale instance pairs (patch and context levels).
- **CONAD** [^6] enhances the graph based on pre-existing human knowledge and subsequently optimizes the encoder using a contrastive loss function. It then reconstructs the original network to flag anomalies.
- **GRADATE** [^7] adopts random edge modifications as an augmentation strategy and introduces subgraph-subgraph instance pairs into the GAD problem.
